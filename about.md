## About OpenDaylight

Founded in 2013, OpenDaylight is part of LF Networking (LFN), an entity that integrates the governance of participating projects in order to enhance operational excellence, simplify member engagement, and increase collaboration across open source networking projects and standards bodies. Each technical project retains its technical independence and project roadmaps. Learn more about LFN.

Our aim is to grow a strong OpenDaylight and Open Networking ecosystem by facilitating collaboration between developers, end users, LFN member companies and fellow open source projects to produce the most relevant and reliable technology solutions. Together, the OpenDaylight community supports user adoption with training, integration services, community events and other resources around the world.

The work we do is made possible by contributions from LFN’s many Silver, Gold and Platinum member companies, as well as the countless technical contributions from our developer community. As an open source project, the ODL platform is freely available for use under the Eclipse Public License (EPL), and anyone can participate in its development. We strongly believe in working together to solve our industry’s shared challenges, and fostering a community where we all “leave our company badges at the door.” Learn how to get started with OpenDaylight as a developer.

## What is SDN?

The modern software-defined networking (SDN) movement grew out of a simple question: why shouldn’t networking devices be programmable just as other computing platforms are?

The benefits of such an approach were obvious: no more arcane protocols to learn. No more waiting and hoping for networking vendors to develop specialized features you need. And if you could develop your own features, you could then optimize your device selection for price and performance independently of feature-richness.

By disaggregating the vertically integrated network device stack, and reimagining the control plane as a device-independent operating system, several longstanding goals can now be achieved:

- Interoperability of different physical and virtual device types from different vendors.
- Optimization of device selection–for price and performance independently of services features.
- Continuous visibility of flows from source to destination.
- Common management framework for all devices.
- Programmability to shape network behavior according to users’ needs.
- Automation of and by policy.

Network functions virtualization (NFV) brought the concept of compute virtualization to networking. The two have become closely intertwined, as SDN drives on-demand deployment of virtual network services when and where they are needed.

The drive for network programmability naturally led to an embrace of open source networking initiatives at every layer of the networking stack. OpenDaylight is the by far the largest and most mature project in this new stack, and a core component of the open source networking ecosystem.
